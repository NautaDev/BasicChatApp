# BasicChatApp
Basic Chat App created using Android Studio 3.0.1 and Parser (back4apps)

This is a basic chat app I created for two reasons:
1. Just practice and learn more about Android and Parser
2. To create a tutorial about it in my website and YouTube channels

It uses Parser for the online features (basically, the chat). Since parse.com is not available anymore, I have found another site that allows you to use Parser systems for free, it is called back4apps. So, this is what I will use in this app.

# Changelog
This will be a really simple changelog, just to see what I have done and what I am going to do:

* 2018/05/10 - Added Parse SDK (from back4apps site) and configured it
* 2018/05/10 - Initial commit, it is just a fresh new Android Studio project, without nothing special
